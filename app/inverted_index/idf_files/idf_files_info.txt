Each pickle file contains the following python object:

{
    "<token that starts with a specific letter>": IDF,
    "<token that starts with a specific letter>": IDF,
    ...
}

IDF = Inverse document frequency = A measure of how important a token is across the entire data set

Each pickle file's name tells what tokens it contains. A-IDF.pkl contains only tokens that start with the letter A
